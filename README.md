# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The work day scheduler shows a time block for standard 9 - 5 business hours. It allows you to add comments or an event to the text section, and it saves to local storage when you click the save icon. It also color codes each time block according to whether or not the hour is past, present, or currently happening.

## Notes

I think I could have handled the saving functionality a bit better. It certainly works properly, but it might be a pretty round-about way of handling it.
